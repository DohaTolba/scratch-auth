## Scratch Auth
### A home-rolled user authentication scheme

This is the Rails app produced by following [this article](http://nycda.com/blog/basic-user-authentication-model-in-rails-4/) from the [New York Code + Design Academy's](http://nycda.com) blog.

The main point is that with gems like Devise, people tend to miss out on learning the basics of user authentication. Hopefully by following the tutorial in the article, they'll learn how user authentication actually works under the hood!

The article was majorly inspired by Ryan Bates' [early Railscast on the topic](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch), so kudos to him.
